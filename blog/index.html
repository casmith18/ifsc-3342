            <h2>What I've been watching...</h2>
            <p>Recently I watched the first season of the Netflix show <i>You</i> which was released in 2018. 
                <i>You</i> is a psychological thriller series based on the novel by Caroline Kepnes, starring Penn 
                Badgley as Joe Goldberg, a bookstore manager and serial killer who becomes obsessed with 
                Guinevere Beck (Elizabeth Lail), an aspiring writer and his customer. The show follows Joe’s 
                twisted attempts to win Beck’s love and eliminate anyone who stands in his way.</p>
            <p>The first season of <i>You</i> has some intriguing elements, such as the use of Joe’s narration to 
                reveal his inner thoughts and justify his actions, the exploration of social media and privacy
                 issues, and the contrast between Joe’s charming facade and his dark reality. The show also features
                  some suspenseful moments and twists that keep the viewers hooked.</p>
            <p>However, the first season also suffers from some flaws, such as the inconsistent characterization 
                of Beck, who sometimes seems smart and independent, and other times naive and dependent. The show
                 also relies too much on coincidences and plot holes to move the story forward, such as Joe’s 
                 ability to stalk Beck without being noticed, or Beck’s lack of curiosity about Joe’s past. The 
                 show also tends to romanticize Joe’s toxic behavior and make him sympathetic, despite his 
                 violent and manipulative actions.</p>
            <p>Overall, the first season of <i>You</i> is a decent but flawed adaptation of the novel, 
                that offers some entertainment value but also raises some ethical and moral questions. 
                It is not for everyone, especially those who are sensitive to violence or abuse. It is a 
                show that can be binge-watched for its addictive quality, but also criticized for its problematic aspects. 6/10.</p>

            <h2>What I've been playing...</h2>
            <p>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is a massive open-world RPG that promises a rich and immersive story, a vast and varied world
                 to explore, and a dynamic and rewarding combat system. However, after playing the first 15 hours of the game, I found 
                 myself frustrated and disappointed by the horrible controls that marred an otherwise enjoyable experience.</p>
            <p>The Witcher 3 puts you in the role of Geralt of Rivia, a professional monster hunter who is searching for his missing adopted 
                daughter Ciri, who is being pursued by a mysterious and powerful force known as the Wild Hunt. Along the way, you will encounter 
                various characters, factions, quests, and monsters that will shape your adventure. The game boasts a branching narrative that adapts 
                to your choices and actions, making every playthrough unique.</p>
            <p>The game’s world is stunningly beautiful and detailed, with diverse landscapes, weather effects, and day-night cycles. 
                The game also features impressive voice acting, dialogue, and music that create a captivating atmosphere. The game’s lore and characters 
                are rich and complex, drawing from the novels by Andrzej Sapkowski and the previous games in the series.</p>
            <p>The game’s combat system is fast-paced and challenging, requiring you to use a combination of swords, magic signs, bombs, crossbows, 
                potions, oils, and decoctions to defeat your enemies. You can also customize your character’s skills and equipment to suit your preferred
                 playstyle. The game offers a variety of enemies to fight, from humans and animals to vampires and werewolves. The game also features some 
                 epic boss battles that test your skills and strategy.</p>
            <p>However, all these positive aspects are overshadowed by the game’s horrible controls, which make playing the game a frustrating and tedious ordeal. 
                The game’s movement controls are sluggish and unresponsive, making Geralt feel like he is moving through molasses. The game’s 
                camera controls are erratic and unreliable, often getting stuck behind objects or enemies. The game’s combat controls are clunky 
                and inconsistent, making it hard to execute precise attacks or dodges. The game’s inventory controls are cumbersome and unintuitive,
                 making it a hassle to manage your items or switch between them.</p>
            <p>The game’s controls are so bad that they often ruin the immersion and enjoyment of the game. I found myself dying or failing quests not 
                because of my lack of skill or strategy, but because of the game’s faulty controls. I also found myself avoiding exploration or combat 
                not because of lack of interest or challenge, but because of the game’s annoying controls. I also found myself losing track of the story 
                or skipping dialogue not because of lack of attention or care, but because of the game’s distracting controls.</p>
            <p>In conclusion, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is a game that has a lot of potential and promise, but is severely hampered by its horrible 
                controls. The game’s controls are so bad that they make playing the game a chore rather than a pleasure. The game’s controls are so bad 
                that they overshadow the game’s many strengths and virtues. The game’s controls are so bad that they make me want to stop playing the game altogether. 5/10 (in progress).</p>
