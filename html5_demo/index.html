        <p>Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is. Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. What?! You don't believe in the Force, do you?</p>

        <p>You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home! I care. So, what do you think of her, Han? You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away! You don't believe in the Force, do you?</p>
        <ul>
          <li>HAN SHOT FIRST</li>
          <li>But I was going into Tosche Station to pick up some power converters!</li>
          <li>What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like&hellip;suicide.</li>

        <h1>An actual tragedy</h1>
        <p>Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise? I thought not. It’s not a story the Jedi would tell you. It’s a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life… He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying.

And that's why i started this whole clan thing in the first place. People are still waiting for the Vanguard to lead the way. But it's time for a change! And guardians like you are making it happen.

        <p>Whether we wanted it or not, we've stepped into a war with the Cabal on Mars. So let's get to taking out their command, one by one. Valus Ta'aurc. From what I can gather he commands the Siege Dancers from an Imperial Land Tank outside of Rubicon.<a href="#">Read More</a>&raquo;</p>
